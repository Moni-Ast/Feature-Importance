It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, system science and computer science. The process of modelling strategic interaction between two or more players in a situation containing set rules and outcomes. \n",

    "Ex: Prisonoer's dilemma - two suspects for a crime - they can either testify against each other or confess they have both done the crime - the best strategy for them is to not confess but most rational people prefer to confess and testify against the other person than stay silent and take the chance the other party confesses\n",

    "    - the sum of the weights of all the marginal contributions to 1 feature models should equal the sum of the weights of all the marginal contributions to 2 feature models and so on ... In other words, the sum of all the weights on the same row should equal the sum of all the weights on any other row\n",

By replacing feature values with values from random instances, it is usually easier to randomly sample from the marginal distribution.

TreeSHAP solves this problem by explicitly modeling the conditional expected prediction\n",
